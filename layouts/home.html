        Lately I mostly work on Go backend services running in the cloud. I strive to continuously iterate on what Iâ€™m
        building to get at the very core of the problem being solved. I believe empathy is the most important part of
        building software: I always try to look at the problem from the user's perspective, and I endeavor to be the
        best teammate I can be.

        I fell in love with coding while taking a computer science class on a whim in undergrad, and have been a devoted
        student of the craft ever since. Software is my profession, but it's also my hobby so I'm usually tinkering
        around with something.
